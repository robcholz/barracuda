//! The extraction seam: reconciling durable memory against a conversation.
//!
//! Extraction is "read the recent conversation *and the current memory*, decide
//! what should change, and emit a few [`MemoryOp`]s". *How* that is done (an LLM
//! call, a heuristic, nothing) is a policy injected as an [`Extractor`],
//! mirroring how [`Compactor`](claw_memory::Compactor) is injected into the
//! conversation tape. The long-term memory adapter owns the *mechanism* (when to
//! extract, routing new facts to a tier, applying edits/removals, persisting);
//! the `Extractor` owns only the *transformation*, so it stays free of any
//! storage concern.
//!
//! Giving the extractor the current memory (as [`MemorySnapshot`]s carrying each
//! item's id) is what lets it go beyond appending: it can reference an existing
//! id to [`Replace`](MemoryOp::Replace) a stale fact or [`Forget`](MemoryOp::Forget)
//! one the user retracted, instead of only ever adding.
