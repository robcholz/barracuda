# Trace Format Specification

`claw-log`'s `FlatTreeSubscriber` flattens the tracing span tree into single lines that an offline parser can reconstruct back into a tree. This document is the **authoritative definition**; the `trace.rs` implementation and its unit tests must follow it strictly.

## Line Structure

```
TRACE <timestamp> <type> <tracing-context> <incremental-context>* <custom-context>
```

- Anything before `TRACE` is the transport-layer prefix (ESP_LOG's `I (…) tag:` / the host logger's prefix) and is **not part of this format**; parsing starts at the `TRACE` marker.
- `<timestamp>`: framework-filled **monotonic timestamp (ms, since boot; on host normalized to an equivalent monotonic clock)**, the first token after `TRACE`. The duration of a span is the `<timestamp>` difference between its `exit` and `enter` and **does not depend on the transport prefix**.
- The three layers, and the tokens inside each `<...>`, are separated by a **single space** (no alignment padding); a line never contains a newline (`\n` is converted to a space before emit).
- Each token inside `<...>` is `key=value`, and **neither key nor value may contain a space** (space is the separator). The writer asserts this with `debug_assert!`; anything containing spaces must go in the custom context.
- **All parsable structural information lives inside the `<...>` blocks**; everything after them is the custom context — free text, **not parsed** (spaces / commas / pipes / angle brackets are all allowed).
- A line begins with exactly one tracing-context block, followed (on `enter` only) by **zero or more** incremental-context blocks `<context=group …>`. The parser reads the leading `<...>` blocks; the remainder of the line is the custom context.

## ① `<type>`

`enter` (enter a span) / `exit` (leave a span) / `event` (an instantaneous record inside a span).

## ② tracing-context (framework-filled, one `<...>` block)

Coordinates the framework derives from metadata, the active span stack, and logical-task inheritance. Contents are fixed per type:

| type | `<...>` contents |
|------|------|
| `enter` | `span=<id> parent=<id\|none> task=<label> span-name=<name> target=<module>` |
| `exit`  | `span=<id> task=<label>` |
| `event` | `span=<id\|none> task=<label> event-name=<name> target=<module>` |

- `span`/`parent`: a framework-assigned, **monotonically increasing, never-recycled** unique id (not the raw tracing id), globally unique across the whole trace stream, so pairing/tree-building is unambiguous.
- `span`: the id of the span this record belongs to; for an `event` with no enclosing span it is `none` (how the consumer renders an orphan is decided by the visualizer and is out of scope for this spec).
- `parent`: the id of the parent span; the outermost span has no parent and is recorded as `none`.
- `task`: the logical async-task label used as the offline/Chrome lane. A span opens a logical task with the reserved `trace.task=<label>` field; that field is consumed by `claw-log` and is not emitted as custom context. Descendant spans and events inherit the label, and the span's `exit` reuses its stored label even if the future resumes or is dropped on another executor thread. Whitespace in an explicit label is normalized to `_` so it remains one structural token.
- If no enclosing span has opened `trace.task`, `task` falls back to the host thread name or ESP FreeRTOS task name. This fallback identifies synchronous/control work only; it is not an async task identity.
- `enter`/`exit` come **one pair per span**, corresponding to span creation/destruction (not per poll); they are paired by the same `span` (duration = the `<timestamp>` difference), and the span name is looked up by `span` from the `enter` line.

Every independently scheduled future whose span lifetime may overlap another future must open its own stable `trace.task`. Reusing a physical executor-thread label for overlapping async work violates the format's per-task replay contract.

## ③ incremental-context (caller-configured groups, `enter` only)

Inherited context is organized into one or more **named groups**, each a closed, ordered key set. Groups are **not** baked into `claw-log`; the caller registers them at subscriber init:

```rust
TracingConfig::default()
    .with_context_group_keys(
        "run",
        ["system", "session", "turn", "agent", "iteration"],
    )
```

`claw_core` registers the `run` group above (fixed order
`system → session → turn → agent → iteration`); other subsystems may register
their own groups. `system` is the semantic agent-system root for startup/global
records; it is a scope label, not an allocated or persisted runtime id.

Each group that opens at least one key on a span renders as its own block on that span's `enter` line, in registration order:

```
<context=<group> <key>=<value> …>
```

**Call site (how a field becomes incremental context):** a span field named `group.key` (dotted) is routed to that group's context; any other field is custom context.

```rust
info_span!(
    "agent",
    trace.task = %agent_id,
    run.agent = %agent_id,
    depth = 1,
);
//  trace.task: reserved logical-task control field
//  run.agent:  group=run, key=agent
//  depth:      custom context
```

- A field's `group` prefix must be a registered group **and** its `key` must be in that group's closed set; a registered prefix with an unknown key is a typo and trips `debug_assert!`. A dotted field whose prefix is **not** a registered group (e.g. `http.method`) is ordinary custom context.
- Within one logical task, a key appears on the `enter` line of the span that opens or changes it; ordinary descendant lines and events do **not** repeat it.
- A span that opens a new `trace.task` is the exception: its `enter` line repeats the **complete effective context** (inherited context plus its own fields). The new task therefore seeds an independent per-task stack instead of depending on the executor thread's stack. Descendants on that task return to incremental deltas.
- The consumer reconstructs context independently per `task`: `enter` pushes, `exit` pops, and the full context of any line is the merged task stack (child overrides parent), per group. Events use their explicit `span` id after the span's context has been reconstructed.
- **Prefix-closed (per group)**: because the span hierarchy is a fixed nesting, a group's reconstructed key set is always a prefix of its declared order — e.g. for `run`, `session` present ⟹ `system` present; `agent` present ⟹ `system`+`session`+`turn` present; `iteration` present ⟹ all four earlier keys are present. There is never a "has `agent` but missing `turn`" gap.
- The canonical Chrome exporter rejects `run.session` without `run.system`; it
  does not support the older context shape. An empty `run` prefix is valid:
  records outside both scopes are exported as `unattributed`.
- A group that opens no key on a span emits **no block** (no empty `<context=…>`). `event` lines carry no incremental block at all.

## ④ custom-context (call site, free-form)

Each span/event's own content — **developer-defined, no format requirement, no `|`** — appended verbatim after the `<...>` blocks; the framework does not parse it.

- Only `enter` (span creation arguments) and `event` (record content) may carry a custom context.
- An `exit` line has only the tracing context (`span=<id> task=<label>`); it carries **neither incremental nor custom context**.
- The canonical Chrome exporter treats ordinary numeric `key=value` fields as
  event arguments. A field opts into a Chrome counter only with the explicit
  `counter.<series>=<number>` form; the exported series name omits the
  `counter.` prefix. A nonnumeric explicitly marked value is an export error.

## Span Hierarchy

`orchestrator` (opens `system`) > `session` (opens `session`) > `turn`
(opens `turn`) > `agent` (opens `agent`) > `iteration_loop` (opens
`iteration`). Startup restore uses `orchestrator` > `session.restore` >
`agent.create`; system-wide startup such as `agent.factory` stays directly
below `orchestrator` with no session key.

- span = a unit of work with a start and end (`enter`/`exit` paired); event = an instantaneous fact.

## Example (overlapping async agents)

```
TRACE 2090 enter <span=1 parent=none task=agent-runtime span-name=agent.runtime target=claw_core::runtime::worker> <context=run system=agent-system>
TRACE 2100 enter <span=2 parent=1 task=session-1 span-name=session target=claw_core::session::manager> <context=run system=agent-system session=session-1>
TRACE 2105 enter <span=3 parent=2 task=session-1 span-name=turn target=claw_core::session::actor> <context=run turn=turn-7> cause=user_submit
TRACE 2110 enter <span=4 parent=3 task=agent-1 span-name=agent target=claw_core::multiagent::drive> <context=run system=agent-system session=session-1 turn=turn-7 agent=agent-1> kind=conversation depth=0
TRACE 2112 enter <span=5 parent=4 task=agent-1 span-name=iteration_loop target=claw_core::agent::iteration_loop> <context=run iteration=iteration-0>
TRACE 2120 enter <span=6 parent=3 task=agent-2 span-name=agent target=claw_core::multiagent::drive> <context=run system=agent-system session=session-1 turn=turn-7 agent=agent-2> kind=tool depth=1
TRACE 2121 event <span=6 task=agent-2 event-name=polled target=claw_core::multiagent::drive> ready=true
TRACE 2130 exit <span=6 task=agent-2>
TRACE 2150 event <span=5 task=agent-1 event-name=completion target=claw_core::agent::iteration_loop> status=done
TRACE 2152 exit <span=5 task=agent-1>
TRACE 2154 exit <span=4 task=agent-1>
TRACE 2156 exit <span=3 task=session-1>
TRACE 2158 exit <span=2 task=session-1>
TRACE 2160 exit <span=1 task=orchestrator>
```

- The orchestrator owns the system lane and the session actor owns the
  `session-1` lane. `agent-1` and `agent-2` overlap in wall-clock time but have
  independent task stacks and therefore independent Chrome lanes. Each new
  session/agent task root repeats its complete context; descendants only add
  deltas. The `completion` event reconstructs as
  `agent-system + session-1 + turn-7 + agent-1 + iteration-0`, while the
  `polled` event reconstructs as
  `agent-system + session-1 + turn-7 + agent-2`.
