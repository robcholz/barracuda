# claw-core Trace

This document defines the `claw-core` trace vocabulary on top of
`claw-log`'s flat-tree trace format. `claw-log` owns the line grammar
(`tracing-context`, `incremental-context`, and `custom-context`); this file owns
the first-party runtime span names and event names emitted by `claw-core` and
its `claw-api` LLM request path, plus incremental `run.*` keys and custom
context fields.

The `run` context is prefix-closed in this order:
`system → session → turn → agent → iteration`. `run.system` is the outer
runtime scope and is present before a session exists. It is a semantic label,
not another runtime identifier.

Trace user data by shape, not by payload. Do not emit raw user text, captions,
attachment file paths, file contents, tool arguments, or model output text. For
messages and attachments, prefer fields such as `has_text`, `text_bytes`,
`attachment_count`, and `attachment_kinds`.

Numeric lifecycle fields are event attributes, not sampled metrics. They remain
in the Chrome instant event's `args` and do not create counter tracks. A real
sampled metric must opt in with the `counter.<series>=<number>` field convention
defined by `claw-log`; do not mark one-off byte/count attributes as counters.

## Levels

The runtime trace vocabulary uses only `info`, `warn`, and `error`.

`info`: Expected lifecycle, progress, and successful state transitions.
`warn`: A request was rejected, optional capability degraded, work was cancelled
or preempted, or a policy/model/tool issue was handled without crashing the
runtime.
`error`: The current operation failed, returned or surfaced an error, or
requested work was dropped because it could not be constructed or driven.

Context-carrying spans (`session`, `turn`, `agent`, `iteration_loop`,
`toolcall`, etc.) use `info_span!` so `info`/`warn`/`error` events retain their
incremental context when the runtime level is `Info`.

## Agent System / Orchestrator

### Tracing Context

span-name: `orchestrator`

The `Orchestrator` is the global runtime root owned by `AgentSystem`. Its
long-lived engine span carries the fixed `run.system=agent-system` semantic
scope and opens the fixed `trace.task=orchestrator` logical lane. No system id
is allocated or persisted.

The root covers engine construction, checkpoint restoration, and the worker
loop. System-wide startup spans such as `agent.manager` and `skill.catalog`
therefore inherit the system context instead of falling into an unknown
session bucket. Synchronous handle operations on the caller thread carry the
same `run.system` explicitly; their task label remains the physical-thread
fallback because they are not independently scheduled async futures.

### Incremental Context

`run.system`: Fixed `agent-system` semantic scope.

### Shutdown

span-name: `orchestrator.shutdown`

The handle-side shutdown and worker join. It carries `run.system`; checkpoint
errors emitted while shutting down inherit that scope.

## Session

### Tracing Context

span-name: `session`

The engine-owned, long-lived session actor root sets `trace.task` to the
session id. Concurrent session actor futures therefore have distinct logical
lanes even when one executor thread polls all of them. Short synchronous
`session` handle spans do not open a logical task.

### Incremental Context

`run.system`: Inherited `agent-system` scope.
`run.session`: Session id.

### Events

`opened`: Session was opened. The event stream is attached and can receive session events.
`open_rejected`: Opening the session failed because it was missing, already open, or the worker stopped.
`submit_accepted`: User input was accepted and queued for a turn.
`submit_rejected`: User input was rejected because the session was closed or busy.
`control_requested`: Interrupt or cancel was accepted for the session.
`control_rejected`: Interrupt or cancel was rejected because the session was closed.
`close_requested`: Close was accepted. The engine starts stream shutdown and cancellation if work is live.
`close_rejected`: Close failed because the session was missing or not open.
`closed`: Session stream close completed. The event stream receives `Closed`; the session id remains live unless a delete requested removal.

### Event Fields

`open_rejected`: `reason`.
`submit_accepted`: `has_text`, `text_bytes`, `attachment_count`, `attachment_kinds`.
`submit_rejected`: `reason`, `has_text`, `text_bytes`, `attachment_count`, `attachment_kinds`.
`control_requested`: `op`.
`control_rejected`: `op`, `reason`.
`close_rejected`: `reason`.

## Session Create

### Tracing Context

span-name: `session.create`

The session id is allocated before this span is opened, so creation and any
registry-checkpoint diagnostics carry both context keys.

### Incremental Context

`run.system`: `agent-system` scope.
`run.session`: Newly allocated session id.

### Events

`created`: Session id was created.

### Event Fields

`created`: `persistence`.

## Session Restore

### Tracing Context

span-name: `session.restore`

One startup span per persisted session runtime restored while constructing the
engine. (A registry-only session with no runtime checkpoint has nothing to
restore.) It is a child of `orchestrator`; restored `agent.create` spans are
children of this span rather than unattributed startup work.

### Incremental Context

`run.system`: Inherited `agent-system` scope.
`run.session`: Restored session id.

## Session Delete

### Tracing Context

span-name: `session.delete`

### Incremental Context

`run.system`: `agent-system` scope.
`run.session`: Session id being removed.

### Events

`registry_removed`: Session id was removed from the registry.
`runtime_state_removed`: Session drive and agent instance state were removed.
`delete_requested`: Delete was accepted.
`delete_rejected`: Delete found no live session to remove.

### Event Fields

`delete_rejected`: `reason`.

## Turn

### Tracing Context

span-name: `turn`

### Incremental Context

`run.turn`: Session-local turn id.

### Span Fields

`cause`: Why this turn is being driven.

### Events

`input_delivered`: User input was delivered to the root agent.
`background_result`: Background subagent work made the root ready again.
`approval_resolved`: User reply resolved a pending approval.
`approval_clarification`: Approval resolver asked the user for clarification.
`output`: Root-visible text was emitted to the session stream.
`error`: Turn drive failed and emitted a session error.
`cancelled_cleanup`: A cancelled turn ran cleanup before ending.

### Event Fields

`input_delivered`: `has_text`, `text_bytes`, `attachment_count`, `attachment_kinds`.
`approval_resolved`: `decision`, optionally `approval`.
`approval_clarification`: `reason`.
`output`: `text_bytes`.
`error`: `kind`.

## AgentManager

### Tracing Context

span-name: `agent.manager`

Manager construction is system-wide startup work. It is a child of
`orchestrator` and inherits `run.system`; it intentionally has no
`run.session`.

### Events

`missing_persistence_dir`: Manager construction rejected an empty persistence root.
`extraction_llm_init_failed`: Internal extraction LLM client failed to initialize.
`long_term_memory_init_failed`: Long-term memory failed to initialize.

### Event Fields

`missing_persistence_dir`: `reason`.
`extraction_llm_init_failed`: `kind`.
`long_term_memory_init_failed`: `kind`.

## Agent Create

### Tracing Context

span-name: `agent.create`

### Events

`unknown_kind`: Agent kind had no baked manifest.
`unknown_tool`: Manifest referenced a tool that is not available.
`transcript_open_failed`: Agent transcript store could not be opened.
`agent_build_failed`: Agent object could not be built.
`context_adapter_attach_failed`: Profile or long-term memory context adapter could not be attached.
`goal_seed_failed`: Initial goal could not be appended to the agent.
`created`: Agent was built and returned to the instance.

### Event Fields

`unknown_kind`: `kind`.
`unknown_tool`: `kind`, `tool`.

`context_adapter_attach_failed`: `agent`, `adapter`, `kind`.
`goal_seed_failed`: `agent`, `kind`.
`created`: `agent`, `kind`.

## Agent

### Tracing Context

span-name: `agent`

`trace.task`: The agent id. This reserved `claw-log` field opens one stable
logical async task/lane for each in-flight agent future; it is consumed by the
subscriber and does not appear as custom context. Child spans and events inherit
the lane across executor-thread changes. `AgentSlots` permits only one in-flight
future for an agent id, so overlapping agent tasks have distinct labels.

### Incremental Context

`run.agent`: Agent id for this subtree.

### Span Fields

`kind`: Agent kind.
`depth`: Agent depth relative to the root agent.

### Events

`awaiting_approval`: Agent parked on a human approval request.
`spawn_materialized`: Requested subagent was built and inserted into the graph.
`spawn_dropped`: Requested subagent could not be built or its parent was gone.
`delete_ignored`: Agent delete request targeted a non-descendant and was ignored.
`result_to_parent`: Subagent result was delivered or queued for its parent.
`root_cancelled`: Root task was cancelled.
`subagent_cancelled`: Subagent task was cancelled and removed.
`subtree_deleted`: Agent subtree was removed from registry, graph, queues, and approvals.
`tool_gate_blocked`: Tool gate blocked one or more tool calls.
`task_failed`: Agent task failed and returned to idle.
`preempt_patch_dropped`: Preempted partial patch had unmatched tool calls and was dropped.

### Event Fields

`awaiting_approval`: `approval`.
`spawn_materialized`: `parent_agent`, `child_agent`, `kind`.
`spawn_dropped`: `parent_agent`, `kind`, `reason`.
`delete_ignored`: `target_agent`, `reason`.
`result_to_parent`: `parent_agent`, `child_agent`, `queued`.
`root_cancelled`: `reason`.
`subagent_cancelled`: `agent`, `reason`.
`subtree_deleted`: `root_agent`, `count`.
`tool_gate_blocked`: `count`.
`preempt_patch_dropped`: `tool_call_count`.

## Iteration Preparation

### Tracing Context

span-name: `iteration.prepare`

### Incremental Context

`run.iteration`: Iteration id being prepared. This is the same id later opened
by the sibling `iteration_loop` span.

### Span Fields

`adapter_count`: Number of context adapters prepared and rendered for the request.

This span brackets all work that must complete before `iteration_loop` starts,
including async context adapters, tool-policy projection, and request-context
rendering.

## Context Compaction

### Tracing Context

span-name: `context.compact`

The span is emitted only when the rolling-summary policy selected a window to
compact. It is a child of `iteration.prepare`.

### Span Fields

`message_count`: Number of history messages passed to the compactor.
`estimated_tokens`: Heuristic token count for the selected window.

### Events

`completed`: The compactor produced a summary segment.
`failed`: Compaction failed without failing the user-facing iteration.

### Event Fields

`completed`: `summary_count`.
`failed`: `kind` (`backend` or `empty_summary`).

## Context Extraction

span-name: `context.extract`

The span is emitted only when the long-term-memory extraction throttle fires.
It is a child of `iteration.prepare`.

### Span Fields

`transcript_version`: Transcript version selected for extraction.
`version_delta`: Change since the previous extraction cursor.
`transcript_bytes`: Byte length of the flattened transcript; never its text.
`existing_count`: Number of existing memory items supplied for reconciliation.

### Events

`completed`: Extraction returned zero or more memory operations.
`failed`: Extraction failed without failing the user-facing iteration.

### Event Fields

`completed`: `operation_count`, `add_count`, `replace_count`, `forget_count`.
`failed`: `kind` (`backend` or `empty_output`).

## Context Render

### Tracing Context

span-name: `context.render`

This synchronous child of `iteration.prepare` covers adapter contribution,
context cache updates, and construction of the model-facing request view.

### Span Fields

`adapter_count`: Number of context adapters rendered into the request.

## LLM Chat

### Tracing Context

span-name: `api.chat`

### Span Fields

`purpose`: One of `iteration`, `conversation_compaction`, or
`memory_extraction`. The auxiliary purposes include any wait to lease their
shared LLM client.

`kind` is a stable shape-only classification: `invalid_tools_json`,
`transport`, `transient_transport`, `parse`, `empty_response`,
`malformed_response`, or `api`. Dynamic transport error text is never traced.
