//! The three traits the agent's context plumbing rests on: the [`History`] read
//! view over the conversation transcript, the [`Transcript`] write face
//! [`TranscriptStore`](claw_memory::TranscriptStore) exposes to the agent, and the
//! pull-based [`ContextAdapter`] every pluggable context source implements.
//!
//! # One transcript, owned by `TranscriptStore`; adapters only read it
//!
//! The conversation transcript has a single owner — the
//! [`TranscriptStore`](claw_memory::TranscriptStore) — which exposes:
//! - [`History`] (read): the message snapshot + a change [`version`](History::version),
//! - [`Transcript`] (write): the boundary writes the agent drives directly.
//!
//! Every [`ContextAdapter`] is a **pure reader**: given a `&dyn History`, it
//! derives context (text blocks and/or structured messages) and may schedule its
//! own background work into its own store. There is no event bus and nothing is
//! pushed at an adapter — an adapter *pulls* the transcript when the agent
//! [`refresh`](ContextAdapter::refresh)es it, and self-detects change by comparing
//! [`History::version`] to a cursor it keeps. This keeps the agent ignorant of
//! every concrete adapter type and makes "the transcript lives in exactly one
//! place, everyone else borrows it" literally true.
