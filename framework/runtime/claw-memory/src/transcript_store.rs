//! `TranscriptStore` — the agent's complete, append-only transcript record.
//!
//! This is the **source of truth** for what was said: every committed turn, kept
//! verbatim, forever (within the store's own lifetime). Its natural unit is a
//! **turn**: one turn's worth of messages, produced together by the agent loop:
//!
//! ```text
//! turn {                        // one group, one [`TurnId`]
//!   user message
//!   assistant message (text and/or tool_calls)
//!   tool result(s)
//!   assistant message
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The store owns, oldest-to-newest:
//! - `turns` — committed turns kept verbatim, each stamped with a monotonic
//!   [`TurnId`] so its chronological position is stable across reloads.
//! - the **open turn** — the in-progress turn (see [`GroupGuard`]), volatile and
//!   not yet stamped.
//!
//! # It does not compact
//!
//! Compaction — summarizing an aged prefix so the transcript fits the model's
//! context window — is **not** this store's job. Compaction is a property of the
//! *LLM request*, not of the record: the summary is a derived artifact assembled
//! at request time by the agent layer's rolling-summary context adapter, which
//! *reads* this store ([`turns_snapshot`](TranscriptStore::turns_snapshot)) and
//! keeps its own summary. This store never deletes a turn, never folds turns into
//! a summary, and has no token budget. It just stores and replays the verbatim
//! transcript. (Bounding on-disk growth, if ever needed, is a separate retention
//! concern — also not compaction.)
//!
//! # Turns are built through a guard
//!
//! Transcript content is appended through either:
//! - a [`GroupGuard`] from [`group`](TranscriptStore::group), for RAII turn
//!   grouping; or
//! - the direct `push_*` methods plus [`commit_open_turn`](TranscriptStore::commit_open_turn),
//!   for an agent loop that already owns the turn lifecycle.
//!
//! Both paths write the same open turn and commit it as a single record, so readers
//! see one transcript regardless of the writer style.
//! A hard cancellation can instead call
//! [`discard_open_turn`](TranscriptStore::discard_open_turn) to drop the volatile
//! open turn without committing it.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! All state mutation (appends, commits, persistence) happens on the
//! **foreground** thread that owns the store. A single store must be driven from
//! one thread; the `Arc`-backed state lets a reader (a context adapter) hold a
//! clone for its read snapshots.
//!
//! # Identity and persistence
//!
//! Each store is keyed by a `transcript_id`. A **persisting** store (built with
//! [`TranscriptStore::new`]) keeps two files under the `dir` it is given:
//!
//! - `<id>.jsonl` — the **data log**: one JSON record per line (`group`),
//!   **append-only**. The source of truth.
//! - `<id>.json` — the **index manifest**: a rebuildable cache listing the byte
//!   `(off, len)` of every record plus `covered_len` and `next_id`, rewritten
//!   atomically as turns are appended.
//!
//! An **in-memory** store (built with [`TranscriptStore::in_memory`]) holds the
//! same transcript but never touches the filesystem: it starts empty and every
//! persist is a no-op. Subagents use it — their transcripts are context-management
//! scratch that is never enumerated or resumed, so it need not survive a restart.
